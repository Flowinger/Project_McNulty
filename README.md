Predicting Travel Destinations

For my third project I tried to predict travel destinations of new AirBnB users based on demographics, like age and gender, sign up behavior, device type and web session records tracking each interaction on the platform. After playing around with different features and trying out various classification models I ran into problems like class imbalance and data leakage. Subsequently, I decided to settle on predicting if a new user is going to book or not.

My main focus for this project was to build a functional web application where I embedded my prediction model.
